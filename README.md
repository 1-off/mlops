After trying to install kubeflow and failed, I decided to brake the problem in several sub-problems/things to learn. 
- juju is a powerful tool to manage mixed type cloud solutionsa as a coherent single system. 
- microk8s is the easiest and fastest way to get Kubernetes up and running. 
- kubeflow is dedicated to making deployments of machine learning (ML) workflows on Kubernetes simple
